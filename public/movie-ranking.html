<h1>The Best Movies According to Elena</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Idol </h3>
<p>Beautiful cinematography with unique ideas, however, the HBOMax series comes with a lot of toxic and triggering imagery,
such as abuse, drugs and cult.</p>

<h3>Avatar </h3>
<p>Amazing movie sequel which did not put down and expectations, but also did not disappoint.</p>

<h3>The Little Mermaid</h3>
<p>A Disney's infamous childs movie, recreated into a live action. A lot of strong initial criticism, however it brings a
a wave of nostalgia.</p>
